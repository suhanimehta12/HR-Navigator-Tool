HR Navigator Tool

Project Overview
The HR Navigator Tool is a comprehensive AI-driven system designed to assist organizations in employee attrition prediction, promotion eligibility, and recruitment decision-making. By integrating advanced data preprocessing, machine learning models, and predictive analytics, the tool provides actionable insights for HR teams. It enables organizations to identify at-risk employees, evaluate candidates for hiring, and determine promotion readiness, thereby improving workforce management and strategic planning.
